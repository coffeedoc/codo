# Codo [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/netzpirat/codo.png)](http://travis-ci.org/netzpirat/codo.png)

Codo is a CoffeeScript API documentation generator, similar to [YARD](http://yardoc.org/). It's generated documentation
is focused on CoffeeScript class syntax for classical inheritance and not for JavaScript's prototypal inheritance.

## Installation

Codo is not released yet. Watch this repo and follow [@netzpirat](http://twitter.com/#!/netzpirat) to get notified
when Codo is ready!

## Supported documentation tags

Codo comments are rendered as [GitHub Flavored Markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/)
and can be tagged to add more structured information to class and method comments.

### Class and method tags

#### @abstract

Marks a class or method as abstract.

```CoffeeScript
# @abstract
class Listener

  # @abstract
  listen: ->
```

### @deprecated

Marks a class or method as deprecated. You can optionally describe the deprecation reason.

```CoffeeScript
# @deprecated Use Stripe
class PayPal

  # @deprecated
  pay: ->
```

### @version

Set the current version of a class or method:

```CoffeeScript
# @version 1.0.9
class Watcher

  # @version 1.0.9
  watch: ->
```

### @since

Set the version when the class or method was first added:

```CoffeeScript
# @since 1.0.2
class Codo

  # @since 1.0.3
  parse: ->
```

### @example

Add your open tasks to a class or method. You can provide an optional example title on the same line as the tag and
you can specify this tag multiple times.

```CoffeeScript
# @example
#   adapter = Adapter.detect()
#   adapter.start()
#
# @example Get adapter for a specific OS
#   adapter = Adapter.for('darwin')
#   adapter.start()
#
class Adapter

  # @example
  #   adapter = Adapter.detect()
  #   adapter.stop()
  stop: ->
```

### @todo

Add your open tasks to a class or method. You can specify this tag multiple times.

```CoffeeScript
# @todo Refactor to use the new mailer library
# @todo Cleanup handlers
class Mailer

  # @todo Enable TLS
  send: ->
```

### @note

Add your open tasks to a class or method. You can specify this tag multiple times.

```CoffeeScript
# @note This class is thread safe
class SocketPool

  # @note Make sure the backend is running
  connect: ->
```

### @author

Marks a class or method as written by a specific author. You can specify this tag multiple times.

```CoffeeScript
# @author Mickey Mouse
# @author Donald Duck
class Cartoon

  # @author Mickey Mouse
  play: ->

  # @author Donald Duck
  wait: (seconds) ->
```

### Method tags

#### @private

Marks a method as private:

```CoffeeScript
class Renderer

  # @private
  detectEngine: ->
```

## Generate documentation

After the installation you will have a `codo` binary that can be used to generate the documentation recursively for all
CoffeeScript files within a directory.

```bash
Usage: codo

Options:
  -i, --input   Set the input directory   [required]
  -o, --output  Set the output directory
```
