# Codo [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/coffeedoc/codo.png)](https://travis-ci.org/coffeedoc/codo)

Codo is a [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) API documentation generator, similar to [YARD](http://yardoc.org/).
Its generated documentation is focused on CoffeeScript class syntax for classical inheritance.

## Features

* Detects classes, methods, constants, mixins & concerns.
* Many tags to add semantics to your code.
* Generates a nice site to browse your code documentation in various ways.
* Can be used to assure minimum documentation
* ~~Documentation generation and hosting as a service on [CoffeeDoc.info](http://coffeedoc.info)~~ (we no longer have the access to domain and the service is currently inaccessible)

## Codo in action

Annotate your source with Codo tags to add semantic information to your code. It looks like this:

```CoffeeScript
# Base class for all animals.
#
# @example How to subclass an animal
#   class Lion extends Animal
#     move: (direction, speed): ->
#
class Example.Animal

  # The Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything
  @ANSWER = 42

  # Construct a new animal.
  #
  # @param [String] name the name of the animal
  # @param [Date] birthDate when the animal was born
  #
  constructor: (@name, @birthDate = new Date()) ->

  # Move the animal.
  #
  # @example Move an animal
  #   new Lion('Simba').move(direction: 'south', speed: 12)
  #
  # @param [Object] options the moving options
  # @option options [String] direction the moving direction
  # @option options [Number] speed the speed in mph
  #
  move: (options = {}) ->
```

Then generate the documentation with the `codo` command line tool. You can browse some
generated Codo documentation on [CoffeeDoc.info](http://coffeedoc.info) to get a feeling how you can navigate in various ways through your code layers.

In the `Example` namespace you'll find some classes and mixins that makes absolutely no sense, its purpose is only to show the many features Codo offers.

## Installation

Codo is available in NPM and can be installed with:

```bash
$ npm install -g codo
```

Please have a look at the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/coffeedoc/codo/releases) when upgrading to a newer Codo version with `npm update`.

## Tags

You have to annotate your code with Codo tags to give it some meaning to the parser that generates the documentation. Each tag starts with the `@` sign followed by the tag name. See the following overview for a minimal description of all available tags. Most tags are self-explaining and the one that aren't are described afterwards in more detail.

Tags can take multiple lines, just indent subsequent lines by two spaces.

### Overview

The following table shows the list of all available tags in alphabetical order with its expected options. An option in parenthesis is optional and the square brackets are part of the Codo tag format and must actually be written. Some tags can be defined multiple times and they can be applied to different contexts, either in the comment for a class, a comment for a mixin or in a method comment.

### Alternative syntax

You can also use curly braces instead of square brackets if you prefer:

```CoffeeScript
# Move the animal.
#
# @example Move an animal
#   new Lion('Simba').move('south', 12)
#
# @param {Object} options the moving options
# @option options {String} direction the moving direction
# @option options {Number} speed the speed in mph
#
move: (options = {}) ->
```

It's also possible to use [CoffeeScript block comments](http://coffeescript.org/#strings) instead of the normal
comments. If you solely use block comments, you may want to use the `--cautious` flag to disable the internal comment conversion.

```CoffeeScript
###
Move the animal.

@example Move an animal
  new Lion('Simba').move('south', 12)

@param [Object] options the moving options
@option options [String] direction the moving direction
@option options [Number] speed the speed in mph
###
move: (options = {}) ->
```

If you want to compile your JavaScript with Google Closure and make use of the special block comments with an asterisk, you want to use the `--closure` flag so that Codo ignores the asterisk.

### Parameters

There are two different format recognized for your parameters, so you can chose your favorite. This one is with the
parameter after the parameter type:

```CoffeeScript
# Feed the animal
#
# @param [World.Food] food the food to eat
# @param [Object] options the feeding options
# @option options [String] time the time to feed
#
feed: (food) ->
```

And this one with the name before the type:

```CoffeeScript
# Feed the animal
#
# @param food [World.Food] the food to eat
# @param options [Object] the feeding options
# @option options time [String] the time to feed
#
feed: (food) ->
```

The parameter type can contain multiple comma separated types:

```CoffeeScript
# Feed the animal
#
# @param [String, Char] input
# @return [Integer, Float] output
#
do: (input) ->
```

Each known type will be automatically linked. Also named parameters are recognized:

```CoffeeScript
class Classmate

  # @param {string} name Full name (first + last)
  # @param {string} phone Phone number
  # @param {obj} picture JPG of the person
  constructor: ( {@name, @phone, picture} ) ->

  # @param {string} reason Why I'm no longer friends
  # @param {Date} revisit_decision_on When to reconsider
  unfriend: ( {reason, revisit_decision_on} ) ->
```

### Options

If you have an object as parameter and you like to define the accepted properties as options to the method, you can use the `@options` tag:


```CoffeeScript
# Feed the animal
#
# @param [Object] options the calculation options
# @option options [Integer] age the age of the animal
# @option options [Integer] weight the weight of the animal
#
expectationOfLife: (options) ->
```

The first parameter to the option tag is the parameter name it describes, followed by the parameter type, name and
description.

### Types

The object types for the `@param`, `@option` and `@return` tags are parsed for known classes or mixins and linked. You can also define types for Arrays with:

```CoffeeScript
#
# @param [World.Region] region the region of the herd
# @return [Array<Animals>] the animals in the herd
#
getHerdMembers: (regions) ->
```

### Properties

You can mark an instance variable as property of the class by using the `@property` tag like:

```CoffeeScript
class Person

  # @property [Array<String>] the nicknames
  nicknames: []
```

In addition, the following properties pattern is detected:

```CoffeeScript
class Person

  get = (props) => @::__defineGetter__ name, getter for name, getter of props
  set = (props) => @::__defineSetter__ name, setter for name, setter of props

  # @property [String] The person name
  get name: -> @_name
  set name: (@_name) ->

  # The persons age
  get age: -> @_age
```

If you follow this convention, they will be shown in the generated documentation with its read/write status shown. To specify type of the property, use the `@property` tag.

### Method overloading

If you allow your method to take different parameters, you can describe the method overloading with the `@overload` tag:

```CoffeeScript
# This is a generic Store set method.
#
# @overload set(key, value)
#   Sets a value on key
#   @param [Symbol] key describe key param
#   @param [Object] value describe value param
#
# @overload set(value)
#   Sets a value on the default key `:foo`
#   @param [Object] value describe value param
#   @return [Boolean] true when success
#
set: (args...) ->
```

The `@overload` tag must be followed by the alternative method signature that will appear in the documentation, followed by any method tag indented by two spaces.

### Virtual methods

If you copy over functions from other objects without using mixins or concerns, you can add documentation for this
virtual (or dynamic) method with the `@method` tag:

```CoffeeScript
# This class has a virtual method, that doesn't
# exist in the source but appears in the documentation.
#
# @method #set(key, value)
#   Sets a value on key
#   @param [Symbol] key describe key param
#   @param [Object] value describe value param
#
class VirtualMethods
```

The `@method` tag must be followed by the method signature that will appear in the documentation, followed
by any method tag indented by two spaces. The difference to the `@overload` tag beside the different context is that the signature should contain either the instance prefix `#` or the class prefix `.`.

### Mixins

It's common practice to mix in objects to share common logic when inheritance is not suited. You can read
more about mixins in the [The Little Book on CoffeeScript](http://arcturo.github.io/library/coffeescript/03_classes.html).

Simply mark any plain CoffeeScript object with the `@mixin` tag to have a mixin page generated that supports many tags:

```CoffeeScript
# Speed calculation for animal.
#
# @mixin
# @author Rockstar Ninja
#
Example.Animal.Speed =

  # Get the distance the animal will put back in a certain time.
  #
  # @param [Integer] time Number of seconds
  # @return [Integer] The distance in miles
  #
  distance: (time) ->
```

Next mark the target object that includes one or multiple mixins:

```CoffeeScript
# @include Example.Animal.Speed
class Example.Animal.Lion
```

and you'll see the mixin methods appear as instance methods in the lion class documentation. You can also extend a mixin:

```CoffeeScript
# @extend Example.Animal.Speed
class Example.Animal.Lion
```

so its methods will show up as class methods.

#### Concerns

A concern is a combination of two mixins, one for instance methods and the other for class methods and it's automatically detected when a mixin has both a `ClassMethods` and an `InstanceMethods` property:

```CoffeeScript
# Speed calculations for animal.
#
# @mixin
# @author Rockstar Ninja
#
Example.Animal.Speed =

  InstanceMethods:

    # Get the distance the animal will put back in a certain time.
    #
    # @param [Integer] time Number of seconds
    # @return [Integer] The distance in miles
    #
    distance: (time) ->

  ClassMethods:

    # Get the common speed of the animal in MPH.
    #
    # @param [Integer] age The age of the animal
    # @return [Integer] The speed in MPH
    #
    speed: (age) ->
```

You can use `@concern` to include and extend the correspondent properties:

```CoffeeScript
# @concern Example.Animal.Speed
class Example.Animal.Lion
```

### Non-class methods and variables

You can also document your non-class, top level functions and constants within a file. As soon Codo detects these types within a file, it will be added to the file list and you can browse your file methods and constants.

## Text processing

### GitHub Flavored Markdown

Codo class, mixin and method documentation and extra files written in
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax are rendered as full
[GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/).

The `@return`, `@param`, `@option`, `@see`, `@author`, `@copyright`, `@note`, `@todo`, `@since`, `@version` and
`@deprecated` tags rendered with a limited Markdown syntax, which means that only inline elements will be returned.

### Automatically link references

Codo comments and all tag texts will be parsed for references to other classes, methods and mixins, and are automatically linked. The reference searching will not take place within code blocks, thus you can avoid reference searching errors by surround your code block that contains curly braces with backticks.

There are several ways of link types supported and all can take an optional label after the link.

* Normal URL links: `{http://coffeescript.org/}` or `{http://coffeescript.org/ Try CoffeeScript}`
* Link to a class or mixin: `{Animal.Lion}` or `{Animal.Lion The mighty lion}`
* Direct link to an instance method: `{Animal.Lion#walk}` or `{Animal.Lion#walk The lion walks}`
* Direct link to a class method: `{Animal.Lion.constructor}` or `{Animal.Lion.constructor A new king was born}`
* Direct link to a module method: `{MyModule~method}` or `{MyModule~method ZOMG I can even refer modules!}`

The `@see` tag supports the same link types, just without the curly braces:

```CoffeeScript
@see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion The wikipedia page about lions
```

## Generate

After the installation you will have a `codo` binary that can be used to generate the documentation recursively for all CoffeeScript files within a directory.

```bash
$ codo --help
Usage: codo [options] [source_files [- extra_files]]

Options:
  --help, -h          Show this help                          
  --version           Show version                            
  --extension, -x     Coffee files extension                                 [default: "coffee"]
  --output, -o        The output directory                                   [default: "./doc"]
  --min-coverage, -m  Require a minimum percentage to be documented or fail  [default: 0]
  --test, -t          Do not create any output files. Use with min-coverage  [default: 0]

  --verbose, -v       Show parsing errors                                    [default: false]
  --undocumented, -u  List undocumented objects                              [default: false]
  --closure           Try to parse closure-like block comments               [default: false]
  --private, -p       Show privates                                          [default: false]
  --analytics, -a     The Google analytics ID                                [default: false]
  --title, -t         HTML Title                                             [default: "Codo Documentation"]
```

Codo wants to be smart and tries to detect the best default settings for the sources, the readme, the extra files and the project name, so the above defaults may be different on your project.

### Project defaults

You can define your project defaults by writing your command line options to a `.codoopts` file:

```bash
--name       "Codo"
--readme     README.md
--title      "Codo Documentation"
--private
--quiet
--extension  coffee
--output     ./doc
./src
-
LICENSE
CHANGELOG.md
```

Put each option flag on a separate line, followed by the source directories or files, and optionally any extra file that should be included into the documentation separated by a dash (`-`). If your extra file has the extension `.md`, it'll be rendered as Markdown.

### API usage

If you want to use codo in your build tool, you can require `codo/lib/command.coffee`:

```coffeescript
CodoCLI = require 'codo/lib/command.coffee'
codoCLI = new CodoCLI()
codoCLI.generate "path/to/base/dir", options, (exitCode) -> process.exit exitCode
```

`option` is an object with options as above. Please note that they are *not* CamelCase (e.g. `min-coverage`
 instead of `minCoverage`). Furthermore only global defaults will be used, project defaults are ignored
 if Codo is used via API. Source files and extra files are lists called `inputs` and `extras` respectively.
 An equivalent to the `.codoopts` file above would be:
 
```coffeescript
options =
    name: 'Codo'
    readme: 'README.md'
    title: 'Codo Documentation'
    private: true
    quiet: true
    extension: 'coffee'
    output: './doc'
    inputs: ['./src']
    extras: ['LICENSE', 'CHANGELOG.md']
```

## Keyboard navigation

You can quickly search and jump through the documentation by using the fuzzy finder dialog:

* Open fuzzy finder dialog: `T`

In frame mode you can toggle the list naviation frame on the left side:

* Toggle list view: `L`

You can focus a list in frame mode or toggle a tab in frameless mode:

* Class list: `C`
* Mixin list: `I`
* File list: `F`
* Method list: `M`
* Extras list: `E`

You can focus and blur the search input:

* Focus search input: `S`
* Blur search input: `Esc`

In frameless mode you can close the list tab:

* Close list tab: `Esc`

## Report issues

Issues hosted at [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/coffeedoc/codo/issues).

The Codo specs are template based, so make sure you provide a code snippet that can be added as failing spec to the
project when reporting an issue with parsing your CoffeeScript code. The other thing that might be useful is the actual exception happening (run with `-d`).
